# Manual-Mode-Automatic-Water-Pumps-Control-System-
To develop a control system to activate and deactivate water pumps according to the user setting. User can set several modes/settings to command the pumps (e.g. Alternate Day, Days wise, Repeat after No. of days etc.). Water Pumps are to be situated at different zones so the user first selects the zones and later the settings. For the project maximum zones are 6.
